# How to Play
Gameplay:
The game is tailored exclusively for desktop gameplay, offering an optimal experience on larger screens.

Players take turns rolling the dice.

Each player's turn consists of the following steps:
1. Roll the dice.
2. Add the numbers rolled on the dice to the player's current turn score.
   
During their turn, a player can choose to:
1. Roll Again: Continue rolling the dice to accumulate more points for that turn.
2. Hold: End their turn and add the turn score to their total score.
   
If a player rolls a 1 on either die during their turn:
Their turn ends immediately, and they lose all the points accumulated during that turn.
The dice are passed to the next player.

# Scoring
The points rolled on the dice are added to the player's turn score.
If a player chooses to "Hold," their turn score is added to their total score.
The first player to reach or exceed the winning score wins the game.
